**Wiki Rules - iGEM 2021**

**CLASS NAMING**

**NOTES**
- This README has been adopted from the 2020 iGEM deliverables.
- This README will be continuously updated as we get information for 2021
- This repository will primarily be used for code dumps for the ENTIRE wiki

**BEFORE YOU START CODING**
- Make sure you’re on Manchester’s teamspace (2021.igem.org/Team:Manchester)
- We are not allowed to edit a space that is not officially allocated to us
- ALWAYS use a webdev environment; VS Code, Atom, Brackets are excellent software options
- Do NOT use Word or Notepad; you will go crazy in less than 5 minutes

**iGEM LOGIN BAR**
- Full-width
- 16px height
- MUST exist on ALL wiki pages
- Contains:
-- iGEM related pages
-- Wiki tools
-- Search tools
-- Team information
-- Login 
-- Site menu
- DO NOT edit, disable, hide or modify the Login Bar (small black strip on top of page)

**STANDARD PAGES**
- iGEM has developed strict weblinks for pages that are considered for awards (more info here)
- Use these links for pages that we want to be considered for evaluation for medals and awards
- When editing this page, there will be preexisting code on the HTML codebase that we will have to DELETE prior to Wiki Freeze
- Do NOT delete any code without telling someone
- We will be keeping code backups for all pages but strict version control will be implemented, especially for the awards and medals pages

**ADOBE FLASH**
- Outdated, known security issues and not open source (against iGEM principles)
- **DO NOT USE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE**

**CONTENT HOSTING PRIVILEGES**
- ALL content (text, images, models, files, etc.) MUST be hosted on iGEM servers
- Load all CSS and JS files into the wiki, do not host on any server other than @iGEM servers
- Hosting content on external servers is cheating and will result in disqualification

Exceptions:
- Can be used to display files hosted on iGEM servers
- Can be used to embed video content from video.igem.org

**COPYRIGHTS**
