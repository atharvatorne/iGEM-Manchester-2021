<h1 class="model-title_p"><b>What have we modelled?</b></h1>

    <p style="font-size:16px;">1. We have modelled the diffusion behaviours of solute molecules within the hydrogel, as a functional property of the material.</p>
    <p style="font-size:16px;">2. We have modelled the production of DispersinB protein as the biofilm degrading enzyme</p>
    <p style="font-size:16px;">3. We have carried our ensemble modelling that quantitatively examined the distribution of parameters and their corresponding results.</p>

<h1 class="model-title_p"><b>Why did we model these?</b></h1>

<ul class="model-ul">
 <li class="model-li"> We aim to use mathematical model to gain a more insightful understanding of our design and help improve our design functionalities.</li>
 <li class="model-li"> Hydrogel relative diffusivity and Dispersin B concentration are needed to predict functioning efficacy of our design</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="model-title_p"><b>How did we model these?</b></h1>

<ul class="model-ul">
 <li class="model-li">[hydrogel:]</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Adopted MSDM model (Axpe, et al., 2019)</li>
  <li>Predicted mesh size using models proposed by Peppas, et al., 2000 and Peppas, et al., 1988</li>
  <li>Used additional models to calculate unreported parameters (see <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:Manchester/Model/Hydrogel"> this</a> page for details) </li>
  <li> Employed ensemble modelling approach to account for the uncertainties in the parameters.</li>

<h1 class ="model-title_p"><b>What have learnt from the models?</b></h1>

<p style="font-size:16px;">1. Hydrogel model: we learnt that the mesh size and the mass-swelling ratio dominate the
relative diffusivity of the hydrogel, and they need to be controlled to ensure the
synthesised hydrogel can function well with our designed bacteria.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">2. Dispersin B model: By analysing the influence of each of the unknown parameter on the
predicted growth of bacteria and the secretion of Dispersin B concentration in
response to pathogenic bacteria growth. We have identified the values at which
our system becomes incapable of controlling the bacteria growth.</p>


<h1 class="model-title_p"><b>How can future teams improve our progress?</b></h1>
<br>

<h3><b>Hydrogel</b></h3>

<p style="font-size:16px;">Due to lack of lab access, we were not physically able to construct the hydrogel
material. Future team can validate our model results by physically synthesising
the hydrogel. Furthermore, the hydrogel-catheter interface interaction needs be
modelled to investigate the adhesion of the hydrogel onto the catheter surface.</p>

<h3><b>DspB</b></h3>

<p style="font-size:16px;"> a. There are 4 parameters that need to be experimentally investigate to further validate our model. The k_dying (rate at which bacteria population declines due to immune system), k_biofilm(rate at which bacteria secretes biofilm), k_break (rate at which DspB breaks down biofilm) and k_AI2(secretion rate of AI-2 by pathogenic bacteria)</p>

<h3><b>Kill switch</b></h3>

<p style="font-size:16px;"> Due to lack of lab access, we were unfortunately unable to measure the rate constants such as the MazF expression levels. This can be further investigated by future teams.</p>
